## Overview

Implement a comprehensive sound effects system that provides authentic casino audio feedback for game actions including card dealing, chip handling, and win/loss outcomes. This system will extend the existing AudioManager foundation with independent sound effects controls and professional casino-style audio cues.

## User Stories

### Casino Audio Feedback

As a blackjack player, I want to hear realistic casino sounds during gameplay, so that I can enjoy an immersive and authentic casino experience.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Player hears card dealing sounds when cards are dealt to them and the dealer
- Player hears chip stacking sounds when placing bets or receiving winnings  
- Player receives distinct audio feedback for different game outcomes (win, loss, blackjack, push)
- Player can independently control sound effects volume separate from background music
- Player experiences professional casino-style audio cues that enhance gameplay atmosphere

### Independent Audio Controls

As a player who wants customized audio experience, I want to control sound effects separately from background music, so that I can have my preferred balance of music and sound effects.

**Detailed Workflow:**
- Player can mute sound effects while keeping background music playing
- Player can adjust sound effects volume independently from music volume
- Player can mute background music while keeping sound effects active
- Audio preferences are saved and restored between game sessions
- All sound effects follow the muted-by-default pattern for user-friendly first experience

## Spec Scope

1. **Sound Effects Manager** - New system that extends AudioManager for one-shot sound playback with independent volume control
2. **Casino Audio Library** - Collection of professional casino sound effects for cards, chips, and game outcomes  
3. **Game Integration Points** - Integration with existing game actions to trigger appropriate sound effects
4. **Independent Audio Controls** - Separate volume and mute controls for sound effects vs background music
5. **Audio Preferences Extension** - Extended preference system to save sound effects settings separately

## Out of Scope

- Advanced audio processing effects (reverb, EQ, spatial audio)
- Custom sound effect upload functionality
- Voice announcements or speech synthesis
- Dynamic audio based on game state changes beyond win/loss outcomes

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Sound Effects System** - Players hear appropriate casino sounds during card dealing, betting, and game outcomes
2. **Independent Audio Controls** - Sound effects can be controlled separately from background music with dedicated UI controls
3. **Professional Casino Audio** - High-quality, authentic casino sound effects that enhance gameplay immersion
