# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-sound-effects-library/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Extend existing AudioManager with SoundEffectsManager for one-shot audio playback
- Implement independent volume and mute controls for sound effects separate from background music
- Support multiple concurrent sound effect playback without audio conflicts
- Integrate sound effects with existing game actions (dealing cards, betting, game outcomes)
- Maintain Web Audio API compatibility and mobile browser support
- Follow existing audio preference storage patterns in localStorage
- Ensure sound effects are muted by default following current audio system patterns
- Implement proper resource cleanup and memory management for sound effect buffers

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Separate SoundEffectsManager Class
- Pros: Clean separation of concerns, independent configuration, easier testing
- Cons: More complex integration, potential code duplication

**Option B:** Extend AudioManager with Sound Effects Capabilities (Selected)
- Pros: Reuses existing audio infrastructure, consistent API, shared audio context
- Cons: Larger class scope, potential coupling between music and effects

**Rationale:** Option B leverages the existing AudioManager infrastructure while maintaining separation through distinct methods and preferences. This approach minimizes code duplication and ensures consistent audio context management across the application.

## External Dependencies

- **Web Audio API** - Already in use, no new dependency
- **Audio Files** - Professional casino sound effect files (mp3/ogg format)
- **Justification:** Web Audio API provides the necessary functionality for concurrent audio playback. High-quality audio files are essential for authentic casino experience.

## Implementation Architecture

### Extended AudioManager Structure
```typescript
interface SoundEffectPreferences {
  volume: number // 0-100, independent from music
  isMuted: boolean // independent from music mute
}

interface ExtendedAudioPreferences {
  music: AudioPreferences
  soundEffects: SoundEffectPreferences
}
```

### Sound Effect Categories
- **Card Sounds:** card-deal, card-flip, card-slide
- **Chip Sounds:** chip-place, chip-stack, chip-collect
- **Outcome Sounds:** win, loss, blackjack, push, bust

### Integration Points
- Card dealing animations trigger card sound effects
- Betting actions trigger chip sound effects  
- Game state changes trigger outcome sound effects
- Audio controls provide separate sliders for music and sound effects
