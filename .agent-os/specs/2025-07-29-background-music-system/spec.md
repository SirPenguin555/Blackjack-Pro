## Overview

Implement a comprehensive background music system that enhances the casino atmosphere with ambient music tracks, volume controls, and user audio preferences management. This feature will provide authentic casino ambiance while giving users full control over their audio experience.

## User Stories

### Casino Atmosphere Enhancement

As a casual casino player, I want to hear realistic casino background music while playing, so that I feel immersed in an authentic casino environment and enjoy a more engaging gaming experience.

The system should automatically start playing ambient casino music when entering the game, with smooth looping and professional audio quality that enhances the gambling atmosphere without being distracting during gameplay.

### Audio Control Management

As any type of user, I want to control the background music volume or mute it entirely, so that I can customize my audio experience based on my preferences and environment.

Users should have access to intuitive volume controls that allow them to adjust music levels independently, with settings that persist across gaming sessions and provide immediate audio feedback.

### Audio Preference Persistence

As a returning player, I want my audio settings to be remembered between sessions, so that I don't have to reconfigure my preferred audio levels every time I play.

The system should store user audio preferences locally and restore them automatically when returning to the game, maintaining consistent user experience across multiple play sessions.

## Spec Scope

1. **Background Music Playback** - Implement looping ambient casino music during gameplay
2. **Volume Control Interface** - Create user-friendly volume slider controls for music adjustment
3. **Audio Preference Storage** - Save and restore user audio settings using localStorage
4. **Multiple Music Tracks** - Support for different casino-style ambient music tracks

## Out of Scope

- Sound effects for game actions (card dealing, chip sounds, etc.)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Background music plays automatically during gameplay with professional casino ambiance
2. Volume control slider allows users to adjust music levels from 0-100% with real-time feedback
3. Mute/unmute functionality provides instant audio control with visual feedback
4. User audio preferences persist across browser sessions and are restored automatically
