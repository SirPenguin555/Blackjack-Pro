# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-29-background-music-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-29
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Audio Format Support:** MP3 and OGG formats for cross-browser compatibility
- **File Size Optimization:** Audio files should be under 5MB each for fast loading
- **Browser Audio API:** Utilize HTML5 Audio API for music playback and volume control
- **Volume Range:** 0-100% volume control with smooth transitions
- **Persistence Layer:** localStorage for saving user audio preferences
- **Performance:** Audio loading should not block game initialization
- **Memory Management:** Proper audio resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallback when audio fails to load or play
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Touch-friendly volume controls and autoplay policy compliance

## Approach Options

**Option A:** HTML5 Audio Element with Custom Controls
- Pros: Simple implementation, native browser support, small footprint
- Cons: Limited audio control features, potential mobile autoplay issues

**Option B:** Web Audio API with Advanced Controls (Selected)
- Pros: Precise volume control, better mobile support, fade effects capability
- Cons: More complex implementation, larger codebase

**Option C:** Third-party Audio Library (Howler.js)
- Pros: Cross-browser compatibility, rich feature set, well-documented
- Cons: Additional dependency, bundle size increase

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of control and performance. The Web Audio API gives us precise volume control and better mobile device compatibility, which is crucial for our responsive design goals. While more complex than basic HTML5 audio, it provides the professional audio experience expected in a casino application.

## External Dependencies

- **Web Audio API** - Native browser API for audio processing and playback
- **Justification:** No external library needed as Web Audio API provides all required functionality with better performance and smaller bundle size

## Implementation Architecture

### Audio Management System
- `AudioManager` class to handle all audio operations
- `MusicPlayer` component for background music control
- `AudioPreferences` utility for localStorage management
- Volume control integration with existing UI components
