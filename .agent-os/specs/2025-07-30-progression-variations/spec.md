## Overview

Implement Phase 4 of the Blackjack roadmap by adding progressive table levels, blackjack rule variations, an unlock system based on player progress, and advanced statistics tracking. This phase transforms the existing single-tier game into a progression-driven experience with multiple rule sets to maintain long-term player engagement.

## User Stories

### Progressive Table Access

As a developing blackjack player, I want to unlock higher-stakes tables as I improve my skills and bankroll, so that I can experience meaningful progression and face appropriate challenges for my skill level.

Players start at the Beginner Table ($5-25 betting range) and can unlock Bronze ($10-50), Silver ($25-100), Gold ($50-250), and Diamond ($100-500) tables based on their performance metrics including hands played, win rate, and current bankroll.

### Rule Variation Discovery

As an experienced player, I want to play different blackjack variations with distinct rule sets, so that I can explore strategic differences and maintain interest through varied gameplay experiences.

Players can unlock and switch between Vegas Rules (dealer hits soft 17, double after split allowed), European Rules (dealer stands on all 17s, no hole card), and Atlantic City Rules (late surrender allowed, dealer peeks for blackjack) based on their table progression.

### Achievement-Based Progression

As a motivated player, I want to earn achievements and complete bankroll challenges, so that I can demonstrate my mastery and be rewarded for specific accomplishments beyond basic gameplay.

Players can pursue achievements like "Perfect Strategy" (100 hands with optimal basic strategy), "High Roller" (win a hand with $500 bet), and complete challenges like "Double Down Master" (win 10 consecutive double down hands).

## Spec Scope

1. **Progressive Table System** - Five distinct table levels with increasing betting limits, visual themes, and unlock requirements
2. **Blackjack Rule Variations** - Three major rule sets (Vegas, European, Atlantic City) with accurate strategy implications
3. **Progress-Based Unlock System** - Dynamic access to tables and variations based on player performance metrics
4. **Advanced Statistics Dashboard** - Comprehensive analytics including win rate by table, strategy accuracy, and progression tracking
5. **Achievement System** - Milestone-based rewards with visual badges and progress indicators

## Out of Scope

- Tournament integration (reserved for Phase 5)
- Monetary rewards or real-money gambling features
- Social leaderboards across all users (limited to personal achievements)
- Additional blackjack variants beyond the three specified rule sets
- Table customization beyond the predefined progressive levels

## Expected Deliverable

1. Players can seamlessly progress through five table levels with distinct betting ranges and visual atmospheres
2. Three complete blackjack rule variations are playable with accurate strategy engine adjustments for each
3. A comprehensive statistics dashboard displays detailed analytics and progression metrics in the browser
