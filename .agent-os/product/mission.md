## The Problem

### Limited Authentic Casino Experience

Most online blackjack games are oversimplified slot-style games that don't teach proper strategy or provide realistic casino atmosphere. Players seeking authentic gameplay are left with limited options.

**Our Solution:** Provide casino-accurate blackjack with proper dealer behavior, betting systems, and authentic rules.

### Steep Learning Curve for Beginners

New players find blackjack intimidating due to complex strategy, multiple variations, and fear of making costly mistakes in real casinos.

**Our Solution:** Interactive tutorials, easy mode, and real-time strategy advice that demonstrates proper play while guiding beginners.

### Lack of Social Casino Options

Existing blackjack games don't offer meaningful multiplayer experiences or customizable rules for private games with friends.

**Our Solution:** Full multiplayer support with host-customizable house rules and tournament systems.
