## 2025-07-29: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Build a comprehensive casino-style blackjack web application targeting casual players and beginners, featuring interactive tutorials, strategy guidance, multiplayer functionality, and progressive unlockable content. The application will prioritize authentic casino rules while maintaining accessibility for learning players.

### Context

The online casino game market lacks quality blackjack experiences that balance authenticity with educational value. Most existing options are either oversimplified slot-style games or intimidating casino simulations without proper learning support. There's an opportunity to create a product that serves both entertainment and educational needs while building a social gaming community.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Simple Single-Player Blackjack**
   - Pros: Faster development, simpler maintenance, lower hosting costs
   - Cons: Limited market appeal, no differentiation, no social features

2. **Full Casino Suite Application**
   - Pros: Broader market appeal, more monetization opportunities
   - Cons: Much larger scope, divided development focus, longer time to market

3. **Educational-Only Blackjack Trainer**
   - Pros: Clear niche market, focused development
   - Cons: Limited entertainment value, smaller user base, monetization challenges

### Rationale

The chosen approach provides the best balance of market opportunity, technical feasibility, and user value. By focusing specifically on blackjack with comprehensive features, we can create a superior experience in this specific domain rather than spreading resources across multiple games. The combination of entertainment and education creates multiple user entry points and longer engagement.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear differentiation from existing casual blackjack games
- Multiple user personas served by single product
- Strong foundation for future expansion into other casino games
- Progressive unlock system creates natural engagement and retention
- Social features enable viral growth potential

**Negative:**
- Higher initial development complexity compared to simple game
- Requires more sophisticated backend for multiplayer features
- Success depends on balancing authenticity with accessibility
- Ongoing maintenance for multiple game variations and social features

## 2025-07-29: Phase 2 Completion and Educational Focus

Completed Phase 2 with comprehensive educational features including interactive tutorial system, easy mode with real-time strategy hints, complete rules reference, and bankruptcy/loan system. All educational components now provide mathematically optimal basic strategy guidance.

### Context

Phase 2 focused on creating an accessible learning experience for beginners while maintaining casino authenticity. The implementation exceeded initial scope by adding advanced features like real-time strategy advice, comprehensive help system, and sophisticated bankruptcy handling.

### Consequences
